A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
